Nth Fibonacci 
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is 0 , the second number is 1 , and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers.
Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number. 
Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as Fo = o and Fl = 1 . For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is FO ; therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to FO , getNthFib(2) is equal to Fl , etc..
